# Enumerable_methods
The Enumerable mixin provides collection classes with several traversal and searching methods,
and with the ability to sort. The class must provide a method each, which yields successive members of the collection.
It's my version implementation of Ruby Enumerable methods in according to assignments to the project.
In this project next methods were rewriting #each, #each_with_index, #select, #all?, any? none?, count(), map(), inject().
All of them were named with prefix my_.
